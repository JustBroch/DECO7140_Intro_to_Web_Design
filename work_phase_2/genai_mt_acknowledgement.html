            <h2>Generative AI and MT Acknowledgement</h2>

            <h3>Acknowledgement of AI Usage</h3>
            <p>
                I acknowledge that I have utilized Generative AI and Machine
                Translation (MT) tools, specifically ChatGPT during the
                completion of this assessment. All usage of these technologies
                has been in strict accordance with the GenAI and MT Usage
                Framework provided for this course. I have followed the
                guidelines for proper use, ensuring that these tools have
                supported my learning process without replacing my independent
                research, analysis, and critical thinking.
                <br /><br />
            </p>

            <h3>Textual content</h3>
            <p>
                Generative AI tools were utilized in revising existing
                descriptions in all textual/docs sections of this proposal to
                improve grammar and enhance sentence structure. All such
                revisions have been used on existing descriptions according to
                the project guidelines and all revisions was critically reviewed
                and edited to ensure alignment with course requirements and my
                personal understanding of the materials.
                <br /><br />
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection on GenAI/MT Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Utilizing GenAI and MT tools provided valuable
                insights—especially in gathering diverse perspectives for the
                Tech and Innovation Communities platform. They hugely improve
                the efficiency of writing and error handling. I verified and
                critically assessed every AI-generated output against
                authoritative sources and my own analysis, ensuring that our
                design decisions remained innovative and ethically sound.
                <br /><br />
            </p>

            <h3>Integrity Statement</h3>
            <p>
                I affirm that my use of GenAI and MT tools in this assessment
                strictly adheres to the GenAI and MT Usage Framework guidelines.
                All AI-generated content, including prompts and user stories,
                has been thoroughly reviewed, revised, and integrated
                responsibly. I take full responsibility for the final content,
                ensuring it reflects my own analysis and insights. The
                assistance provided by these tools has been clearly acknowledged
                and has not compromised the academic integrity of this
                submission.
