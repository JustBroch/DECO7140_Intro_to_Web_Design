            <p>
                Connected Communities Initiative (CCI) wants to create a digital
                platform that is dynamic, easy to use, and accessible. The goal
                is to help communities share their stories and resources. For
                this project, the focus is on Tech and Innovation Communities –
                a space where technology enthusiasts, innovators, and
                professionals can discuss ideas, stay updated on the latest
                trends, and build valuable networks. The website should
                exemplify modern design and functionality while addressing the
                practical needs of its users.

                requirement for a modern, accessible, and functional website
                directly supports these needs. By employing the
                Value‑Needs‑Features Framework, we have identified that:

                    innovation is best met by focusing on dynamic, API‑driven
                    content.
