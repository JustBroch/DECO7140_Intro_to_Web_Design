                <h1>Ethical Response</h1>
                <p>
                    This page outlines the ethical considerations behind the
                    site’s design, such as inclusivity, accessibility, and
                    respect for users’ data and identity.
                </p>
                <h2>Accessibility & Inclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The design aims to be inclusive of users with varying
                    abilities. Key measures include high-contrast color
                    palettes, scalable fonts, alt-text for all media, and
                    semantic HTML. These ensure accessibility for screen readers
                    and users with visual impairments.
                </p>

                <h2>Transparency and Consent</h2>
                <p>
                    The platform respects user autonomy by avoiding manipulative
                    design patterns ("dark patterns") and ensuring that actions
                    like account creation or data sharing are clearly explained.
                    Clear navigation, predictable layouts, and honest labeling
                    support user trust.
                </p>

                <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    While this prototype does not process user data, the design
                    considers how data *would* be treated in a live product.
                    Privacy-by-design principles are considered, such as user
                    control over information and the minimization of tracking or
                    unnecessary data storage.
                </p>

                <h2>Responsible Use of GenAI</h2>
                <p>
                    All use of Generative AI in this project has been clearly
                    documented and critically reviewed. AI has not replaced
                    student effort or analysis, but was used to enhance clarity
                    and support idea generation. This aligns with the ethical
                    and academic guidelines of the course.
                </p>

                <h2>Commitment to Ethical Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Design decisions reflect a commitment to ethics as an
                    ongoing responsibility. The project avoids exclusionary
                    practices and embraces the needs of diverse users—supporting
                    both the client’s values and broader principles of
                    responsible innovation.
