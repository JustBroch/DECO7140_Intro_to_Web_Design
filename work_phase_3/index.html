                        proposed web platform designed for the

                    <p>
                        The final website will serve as a professional

                        innovators to connect, share ideas, and collaborate.
                        Think of it as a simplified version of LinkedIn â€“

                        This style guide demonstrates key components such as
                        typography, color usage, buttons, and layout patterns,
                        all carefully designed to ensure accessibility,
                        consistency, and usability across the site. These design
                        decisions are based on client goals and user needs
                        identified during earlier phases.
