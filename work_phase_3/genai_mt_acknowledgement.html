                    This page acknowledges the use of Generative AI and Machine
                    Translation tools in the design process, and explains how
                    they were used responsibly.
                </p>

                <h3>Acknowledgement of AI Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    I acknowledge that I have utilized Generative AI and Machine
                    Translation (MT) tools, specifically ChatGPT during the
                    completion of this assessment. All usage of these
                    technologies has been in strict accordance with the GenAI
                    and MT Usage Framework provided for this course. I have
                    followed the guidelines for proper use, ensuring that these
                    tools have supported my learning process without replacing
                    my independent research, analysis, and critical thinking.
                </p>

                <h3>Textual content</h3>
                <p>
                    Generative AI tools were utilized in revising existing
                    descriptions in all textual/docs sections of this proposal
                    to improve grammar and enhance sentence structure. All such
                    revisions have been used on existing descriptions according
                    to the project guidelines and all revisions was critically
                    reviewed and edited to ensure alignment with course
                    requirements and my personal understanding of the materials.
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection on GenAI/MT Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    Utilizing GenAI and MT tools provided valuable
                    insights—especially in gathering diverse perspectives for
                    the Tech and Innovation Communities platform. They hugely
                    improve the efficiency of writing and error handling. I
                    verified and critically assessed every AI-generated output
                    against authoritative sources and my own analysis, ensuring
                    that our design decisions remained innovative and ethically
                    sound.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I affirm that my use of GenAI and MT tools in this
                    assessment strictly adheres to the GenAI and MT Usage
                    Framework guidelines. All AI-generated content, including
                    prompts and user stories, has been thoroughly reviewed,
                    revised, and integrated responsibly. I take full
                    responsibility for the final content, ensuring it reflects
