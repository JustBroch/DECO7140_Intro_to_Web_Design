                    <h2>Acknowledgement of GenAI/MT Use</h2>
                    <p>
                        I acknowledge that I have used Generative AI (GenAI) and
                        Machine Translation (MT) tools, specifically ChatGPT,
                        during the development of this project. All use has been
                        in strict accordance with the GenAI and MT Usage
                        Framework and the principles of academic integrity for
                        this course.

                            final decision making.

                    <h2>Reflection on GenAI/MT Usage</h2>

                    <h3>
                        Creativity, Technical Proficiency, and Problem-Solving
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        GenAI tools supported my creativity by helping to refine
                        textual content for various sections of the site,
                        including the About page, values statements, and
                        user-facing descriptions. It also contributed to
                        improving my technical proficiency through guidance on
                        CSS layout strategies and reusable helper classes for
                        spacing and typography.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Challenges and How They Were Addressed</h3>
                    <p>
                        One challenge was ensuring that AI-generated text
                        maintained an appropriate tone, particularly regarding
                        inclusivity and accessibility. Additionally, I needed to
                        carefully review AI-suggested CSS code to ensure
                        compatibility with my mobile-first, responsive design. I
                        addressed these challenges through iterative editing and
                        cross-referencing with my style guide and accessibility
                        requirements.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Evaluation and Refinement Strategies</h3>
                    <p>
                        To ensure quality, I reviewed all AI-generated content
                        multiple times, compared it with authoritative sources,
                        and ensured that it fit the site’s voice and ethical
                        design principles. For technical code, I tested each
                        suggested snippet and only integrated elements that
                        aligned with my overall architecture and quality goals.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Impact on Productivity</h3>
                    <p>
                        GenAI greatly improved my productivity, especially when
                        generating CSS utilities for spacing (e.g.,
                        <code>m-1</code>, <code>p-x-3</code>), refining hover
                        effects, and drafting initial explanatory content. This
                        allowed me to focus more time on accessibility, dynamic
                        functionality, and user experience refinement.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Insights for Future Professional Use</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through this project, I gained valuable insights into
                        how GenAI can serve as a collaborative partner in the
                        design process when used critically. In future projects,
                        I plan to continue using GenAI as a tool to enhance
                        creativity and efficiency while maintaining full
                        accountability for final outputs. I will also remain
                        mindful of transparency, ethics, and potential biases in
                        AI-generated content.

                    <h2>Integrity Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        I affirm that my use of GenAI and MT tools in this
                        assessment fully adheres to the GenAI and MT Usage
                        Framework. All outputs were critically evaluated and
                        refined, and the final submission reflects my own work
                        and understanding, in line with the principles of
                        academic integrity.
