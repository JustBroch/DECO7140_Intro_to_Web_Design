                <h2>Acknowledgement of GenAI Use</h2>
                <p>
                    This acknowledgement explains my use of generative AI
                    (GenAI) tools during the development of this project for
                    DECO7140.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used ChatGPT (OpenAI's GPT-4o model) and Google Gemini at
                    several stages of the design, implementation, and writing
                    process.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Community Feed:</strong> Prompts were used to

                        hard-coded sample profiles.

                        <strong>News Section:</strong> Prompts were used to

                    <li>
                        <strong>Images:</strong> GenAI was used to create
                        suitable images for the site, in order to avoid any
                        potential copyright issues with photos I do not own the
                        rights to.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ChatGPT was used to assist with debugging code and
                        identifying potential errors (such as subtle typos in
                        large code files).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used GenAI to clarify concepts in HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript — for example, by asking prompts such as:
                        <em
                            >"Explain the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                            together to me as if I was 10 years old." This
                            creation of metaphors and simple explanation highly
                            enhances my understanding.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Guidance was also sought for best practices related to
                        ARIA labels and WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I used ChatGPT-4o to revise and improve the grammar and
                        sentence structure of already existing written content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All revisions were based on text I had originally
                        written, and the GenAI tool was used to enhance clarity,
                        flow, and professionalism.

                    <li>
                        All content was manually reviewed and revised after
                        using AI assistance.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I found GenAI to be a valuable support tool in this project.
                    It enhanced my productivity — particularly for debugging and
                    learning — and supported creativity when generating example
                    content and imagery. It also helped me improve the clarity
                    and professionalism of my written work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I see GenAI as a <strong>collaborative partner</strong> in
                    the design process when used critically. However, I remain
                    fully responsible for all content, design decisions, and
                    code quality. I am mindful of the limitations of AI,
                    including potential biases and the risk of over-reliance,
                    and I applied critical judgement to all AI-generated
                    outputs.

                <h2>Challenges and Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    While using GenAI tools, I encountered several challenges.
                    One key challenge was ensuring that suggestions for ARIA
                    labels and accessibility improvements actually aligned with
                    WCAG 2.2 standards, as AI recommendations were sometimes
                    incomplete or outdated. To address this, I consulted
                    additional authoritative resources and manually tested my
                    site using accessibility tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was maintaining my own voice and tone in
                    written content, as GenAI sometimes produced overly generic
                    or formal language. I addressed this by carefully reviewing
                    and editing all revised text to ensure it remained clear and
                    aligned with the project's style and goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, while GenAI was helpful in identifying potential
                    coding improvements, it occasionally suggested solutions
                    that were not fully compatible with my existing architecture
                    or CSS structure. I overcame this by thoroughly testing all
                    code in context and selectively applying only those
                    suggestions that fit my design.
                </p>

                <h2>Integrity Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    I affirm that my use of GenAI tools in this assessment fully
                    adheres to the GenAI and MT Usage Framework for DECO7140.
                    All outputs were critically evaluated and refined, and the
                    final submission reflects my own work and understanding, in
                    line with the principles of academic integrity.
