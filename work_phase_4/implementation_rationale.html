                    <h2>Alignment with Client and User Needs</h2>
                    <p>
                        The website was developed to align with the goals of the
                        Connect Communities Initiative (CCI), focusing on
                        building a space for tech innovators to connect,
                        collaborate, and share knowledge. The design addresses
                        the user needs identified in the A3 Design Proposal,
                        including clarity, accessibility, and ease of navigation
                        for both newcomers and experienced professionals. The
                        platform’s structure and features reflect the priorities
                        outlined in the client brief, supporting engagement
                        through a community feed, interactive post creation, and
                        accessible content.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Accessibility and Ethical Considerations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility principles guided the entire development
                        process, with WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards implemented
                        across navigation, forms, and content presentation.
                        Colour contrasts, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation
                        have been carefully integrated. Ethical considerations,
                        including transparency, user privacy, and inclusivity,
                        were informed by A2 Design Research findings and applied
                        to the handling of user-generated content and overall
                        site interactions.

                <section>
                    <h2>Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some adjustments were made during implementation to
                        improve usability and technical feasibility. For
                        example, the "News" section was introduced as a curated
                        content area, enhancing engagement while remaining
                        aligned with the original community-focused concept.
                        Certain layout refinements were applied to improve
                        responsiveness across devices. These changes remain
                        consistent with the original design intent and user
                        experience goals.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Challenges and Strategies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Key challenges included managing API integration for the
                        community feed and ensuring consistent behaviour across
                        different browsers and screen sizes. To address these,
                        modular JavaScript was used to streamline data handling,
                        and responsive CSS techniques were refined through
                        iterative testing. Additionally, adjustments were made
                        to button styling and form behaviour to maintain a clear
                        and accessible user interface.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Accessibility Audit</h2>
                    <p>
                        An accessibility audit was performed using the IBM Equal
                        Access Accessibility Checker. The audit confirmed
                        compliance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA, with minor
                        adjustments made to improve label association and
                        contrast in certain areas. A screenshot of the audit
                        results is provided below.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Example for including the audit screenshot -->
                    <img
                        src="assets/accessibility_audit_screenshot.png"
                        alt="Accessibility Audit Screenshot"
                        class="responsive-img"
                    />
                    <p>
                        The audit process provided valuable feedback, ensuring
                        that the final implementation delivers an inclusive
                        experience across diverse user groups.
