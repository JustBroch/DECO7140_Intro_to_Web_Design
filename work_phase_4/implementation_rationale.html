                <h2>Alignment with Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>
                    The LoopedIn website was developed in alignment with the
                    <strong>Connect Communities Initiative (CCI)</strong>
                    mission of fostering social cohesion and supporting
                    community identity, with a particular focus on tech and
                    innovation communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project specifically addresses the
                    <em>Tech & Innovation Communities</em> stream from the
                    Client Brief, which emphasises creating platforms where
                    innovators can connect, share knowledge, and build
                    visibility for their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the design and implementation process, I
                    prioritised <strong>features and structure</strong> that
                    enable:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discovery</strong> (News section)</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interaction</strong> (Community Feed and Join
                        the Community functionality)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identity and representation</strong> (Hero
                        section and About page)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The site provides two key interaction pathways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For community members</strong> — tech
                        enthusiasts and innovators looking to connect, post, and
                        engage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For the wider public</strong> — people who wish
                        to explore the community and learn from it.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <section>
                <h2>Accessibility and Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    Accessibility was integrated from the beginning, guided by
                    <strong>WCAG 2.2 Level AA</strong> standards:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators.</li>
                    <li>ARIA labels for icon-based navigation.</li>
                    <li>Semantic HTML with clear heading structure.</li>
                    <li>Appropriate <code>alt</code> text for all images.</li>
                    <li>Colour contrast checked and adjusted to pass audit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ethical design was also a focus:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inclusive content and imagery.</li>
                    <li>
                        Transparent integration of third-party tools
                        (newsletter).
                    </li>
                    <li>Mobile-first design for broad access.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In applying ethical design principles, I drew on the
                    <strong>ACS Code of Ethics</strong> and structured reasoning
                    approaches introduced in the course. Key stakeholders
                    considered include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Site users (including potentially minors or marginalised
                        groups)
                    </li>
                    <li>Site maintainers</li>
                    <li>Developers</li>
                    <li>Funders</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Relevant ACS principles applied include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primacy of Public Interest</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Enhancement of Quality of Life</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Honesty</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The decision to implement the newsletter feature in a
                    transparent, opt-in manner reflects this reasoning, with an
                    emphasis on informed consent, privacy, and user autonomy.

                <h2>Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    As is natural in an iterative process, several adjustments
                    were made during implementation based on
                    <strong>technical feasibility</strong> and
                    <strong>project scope</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>The original site map proposed the following structure:</p>
                <img
                    src="assets/Site_Map.png"
                    alt="Site Map from A3 Design Proposal"
                    style="max-width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0"
                />
                <p>Key changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>My Profile</strong>, <strong>Chat</strong>,
                        <strong>Events</strong>, and
                        <strong>Search</strong> were not implemented, as they
                        were deemed non-essential and outside current scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Core pages now include: Home, About, Community Feed,
                        News, and Join the Community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implementation Rationale and GenAI Acknowledgement are
                        included in the footer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Join the Community now builds on the Work Phase 3 API
                        and functions as an initial post creation page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The News section supports external content curation and
                        engagement.

                <h2>Challenges and Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Accessibility Implementation:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initial challenges included ensuring proper ARIA labeling
                    for icon navigation and consistent focus-visible styling
                    across browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Scope Refinement:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proposed features like Chat and Profile were beyond scope;
                    the focus shifted to delivering a high-quality core
                    community experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Responsive Design:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigation was unified across desktop and mobile; layout
                    grids were refined for consistent presentation on all
                    devices.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Accessibility Audit</h2>
                <p>
                    An accessibility audit was conducted on the Home page using
                    the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker (Chrome
                    extension).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After iterative improvements, the remaining issues are as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Needs review:</strong> Confirm that Windows high
                        contrast mode is supported when using CSS to include,
                        position or alter non-decorative content. This requires
                        manual verification, as automated tools cannot fully
                        assess high contrast support.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Needs review:</strong> Verify that color is not
                        used as the only visual means of conveying information.
                        While underlines and outlines have been added for
                        interactive elements, this is flagged for manual review
                        to ensure full compliance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> The Github link in the
                        footer opens in a new window (target="_blank"). An ARIA
                        label has been added to inform the user, but the
                        automated tool still flags this as a recommendation for
                        improved clarity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> The background image
                        used in the hero section. This image is decorative and
                        does not convey essential content. No alternative text
                        is required, but this is flagged for manual verification
                        in high contrast mode.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, the site now meets the key WCAG 2.2 Level AA
                    requirements. The remaining items are either expected
                    limitations of automated testing or flagged for manual
                    review in future iterations.
